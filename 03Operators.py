# Arthematic Operators 
# this very similar to c++ 

print(" a  +  b   =  " ,a+b)
print(" a  -  b   =  " ,a-b)
print(" a  *  b   =  " ,a*b)
print(" a  /  b   =  " ,a/b)
print(" a  %  b   =  " ,a%b)
# this is float division operator in this cannot see numbers after point 
print(" a  //  b   =  " ,a//b)
# this is exponetiation operator in this can calculate 10^3 
print(" a  **  b   =  " ,a**b)

print(" ")

# comperision operators
print(" a  >  b   =  " ,a>b)
print(" a  <  b   =  " ,a<b)
print(" a  !=  b   =  " ,a!=b)

# Logical Operator 

# In python && is replace by and
# and || is replace by or and ! is replace by not


# It also had bitwise operators
